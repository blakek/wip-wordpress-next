# Next.js Starter

> A small layer on top of Next.js for fast hacking

This is meant as a base for any website built with React and Styled Components,
including:

- quick prototypes
- static generated sites (handled using Next.js)
- sites with API (using Next.js API routes)
- â€¦and more!

If you're planning on using WordPress, see the [wordpress-next] starter.

## How to Use

This is an example repository that is ready to be set up. With [Yarn] installed,
run:

```bash
npx create-gsandf-project --example nextjs new-site-name
```

This creates a new project in the current directory called `new-site-name`.

## Getting Started

[Node.js] and [Yarn] are required to work with this project.

To install all dependencies, run:

```bash
yarn
```

Then, start the local server to get started:

```bash

```
